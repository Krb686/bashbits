# bashbits

This repo contains 6 things:

1) A collection of cool bash tips and tricks I've accumulated and decided to store in 1 place for reference
    Under /notes

2) A library of 60+ bash functions
    /lib

3) A testsuite for each function.
    /testsuite

4) A bash static code analyzer (in progress)
    /analyzer

5) Some bash boilerplate useful for any new script

6) My own .bashrc files
